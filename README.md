This is the LoL-Memory-Game authored by Scott Lawless

this app lets a user play a memory game with some champions from League of Legends.  The User must click each champion only once for a perfect victory.  if the user clicks the sae champion twice before all champions have been matched, their current score will be reset to 0, and if they set a new top score it will be recorded.  each time the user clicks one of the champion images the images will shuffle.
